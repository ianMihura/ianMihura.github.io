I'm passionate about technology and the ways stuff gets built. From webapps, Smart Contracts, hashing algorithms and servers to cameras, video encoding protocols and animation. Studied in many different universities and institutes, from many different people, always absorbing their worldview as their skillset. My path is quite a divergent one, which makes me skilled in a very wide range of subjects regarding technology. I work only in places where I can learn something.</subtitle><author><name>Ian Mihura</name></author></feed>
